A console based game me and a friend wrote in 2006. We used Free Pascal and FPC ide. Sorry for not including any instructions or descriptions, the purpose of this repo is to save the code to the future in a presentable way.

This is the project I learnt the basic concepts of programming with. I know the code is ugly, but that time I learnt a lot with it.

The point is to control an `o` and an `x` character on the terminal windown. When the `x` catches the `o` it wins. Later we added

* Lifes so the `o` doesn't die immediately
* 3 player game where they have to catch each other in a cyclic way
* special fields like walls (cant go though) or traps (loose a life when you step on it)
* possibility to put down your own traps/walls
* AI to control one or more of the characters
* text based menu system to select from 2 or 3 player mode and select who is AI and who is real
* in-game description of the game

Looking back all these features are quite impressive writing the code in one signle file without any OOP and any knowledge about how to structure the code and even with terrible variable names.
